# hex-stickers

A repo for my hex stickers. You can find all the code used to create the hex 
logos as well as the [PNGS](PNG) versions and eventually SVG (work in progress).

```{r, results = 'asis'}
list.files("PNG") %>% 
  sprintf("<p style='align:center'> <img src='PNG/%s' width='200px' /> </p>", .) %>%
  paste(collapse = "\n\n") %>% 
  cat(fill = TRUE)
```
